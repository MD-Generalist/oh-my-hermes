"""Derive a coding handoff's context pack from the project's stored codegraph.

A prepared coding handoff used to reach the coding owner with no map of the
repository unless the caller built one and passed it in (#1696). When the
project already carries a codegraph artifact (`omh codegraph build --write`),
its structurally ranked focus files are the context a coding owner most needs
and OMH can enumerate on its own, so they travel as a `handoff_context_pack/v1`.

Only a stored artifact is read. Building a graph here would scan the whole
tree on every handoff, and a project that never asked for a codegraph keeps
the handoff it had. The pack names files; it carries no file bytes and no task
text, and it is static analysis -- prepared context, never evidence that an
owner opened any of it.
