"""Probe, in the isolation a unit will actually use, that the work can be done.

`executor_readiness` answers one question: does the executor's binary run? On
2026-09-11 that answer was `available: true` for a worker that then spent 36
minutes unable to write a git index it had been told was complete. The clone
was `blob:none` with network fetch forbidden, so objects the merge needed were
simply absent, and case-only filename collisions on a case-insensitive
filesystem blocked the checkout. Every one of those conditions was observable
before the unit started, and none of them was observed.

`--version` exiting 0 says the binary runs. It does not say a file can be
written, an index can be updated, the commits the work names exist, or the
tracked filenames can coexist on this filesystem. Those four are what this
module observes, in the worktree path the unit was handed, with no network
call and a bounded timeout on every subprocess.

A failing check is a BLOCKER, not a retry hint. None of the four clears by
running the same unit again under the same conditions: a permission denial
stays denied, a missing object stays missing until someone fetches it, and a
case collision is a property of the tree and the filesystem. The dispatcher
therefore refuses the spawn and reports which check failed with its detail, so
the repair happens at the preparation step where it belongs.

Nothing here spawns an agent, reads a credential, or reaches a network. It
runs `git` read/write commands against the given worktree, writes only scratch
paths it removes again, and never touches a tracked file or the real index.
