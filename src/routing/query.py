"""One message's routing stages, prepared once.

`RoutingQuery.from_message` runs the router's text-prep chain in order and
keeps every stage by name, so a reader takes the stage it needs instead of
re-deriving the chain at its call site:

1. `raw` -- the message as received.
2. `executable` -- `executable_routing_text(raw)`: quoted and reference
   regions removed. `has_strong_named_catalog_owner` reads it for the
   negated-name check.
3. `scrubbed` -- `scrub_diagnostic_status_text(executable)`: diagnostic status
   lines removed. The scorer passes it to `explicit_skill_invocation` and to
   `_score_definition` as `routing_query`.
4. `routing_text` -- `prepare_routing_text(_strip_path_like_fragments(scrubbed))`:
   path-like fragments neutralized, then locale aliases applied.
5. `normalized` -- `normalized_phrase(routing_text.scoring_text)`: what every
   phrase trigger, guard, and offers-itself predicate matches against.
6. `tokens` -- the router's `_tokens(normalized)`: the token set the scorer
   and the guards intersect with. Frozen here; the scorer mutates sets it
   derives from its token argument, so callers hand it `set(tokens)`.

Readers that need an earlier stage alone (prepare-only or executable-only
call sites in `chat.py`, `playbooks.py`, `route_plan.py`) are different
stages, not copies of this chain.
