    or a model-call receipt. Batch children stay distinct; the parent latch is

    quiet block, so a raise would be swallowed and this would simply stop
    recording -- invisibly, which is the failure worth avoiding. So the swallow

    only on a route whose recorded writer is NOT a live session, so it cannot

    and fail-open, and it carries the `session_id` the decision needs -- which
