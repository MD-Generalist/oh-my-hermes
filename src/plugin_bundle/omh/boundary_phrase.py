"""Word-boundary phrase matching, owned once by the bundle.

`contains_boundary_phrase` decides whether an executor or runtime name is
mentioned in a message rather than merely contained in another word or a file
name. The control plane (`omh.routing.executor_cues`) imports it from here;
the bundle's awareness route hints read it directly. Until 2026-10-06 the
bundle carried a vendored copy for standalone hosts that lacked the rule
rejecting punctuation followed by more alphanumerics, so "see claude-code.md"
and "codex-utils.py" counted as agent mentions on the live plugin while the
control plane rejected them. One definition, no copy. Stdlib only.

def contains_boundary_phrase(text: str, phrases: tuple[str, ...]) -> bool:
    """True when any phrase occurs in `text` at a word boundary.

    Plain containment is wrong for the omo-runtime phrase family: "api한테"
    contains "pi한테", "promo runtime" contains "omo runtime", and "raspi
    status" contains "pi status". An occurrence only counts here when the
    character immediately before the match is absent or non-alphanumeric --
    `str.isalnum()` is True for Hangul (and its NFKD jamo), so "라즈베리pi한테"
    is rejected the same way "raspi" is -- and the run of ASCII punctuation
    immediately after the match (if any) is not itself followed by another
    ASCII alphanumeric character. A lone trailing ASCII punctuation run
    ("pi:", "claude-code.") is a sentence separator or a sentence-ending
    period, so it still counts as a boundary; a Hangul continuation right
    after the phrase ("opencode로", "omo runtime으로", "senpi가") is a particle
    naming the agent, so that counts too. But punctuation that leads straight
    into more ASCII alphanumeric text without a space ("claudecode-notes",
    "claude-code.md", "codex-utils.py") is a hyphenated word or filename that
    merely starts with the phrase, never a mention of it.

    Callers must pass `text` and `phrases` through the same fold
    (`normalized_phrase` on routing surfaces, plain lowering in coding
    delegation); this helper compares them verbatim.
