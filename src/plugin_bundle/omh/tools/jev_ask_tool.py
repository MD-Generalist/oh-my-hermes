"""`omh_jev_ask`: the one explicit, opt-in path by which OMH itself sends data to Jev.

The call is refused before any socket opens unless every gate holds, in this
order: the person named Jev in this turn's own message (`jev_consent`), the
request is well formed and carries no credential-like text, a route resolves
(a `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`, or `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` plus the operator setting), and
no text in the request holds an 8-character window of either configured
route key, compared case-insensitively with whitespace removed. Only then does
`jev_ask_client` send it.

What leaves the machine: `state` exactly as supplied, every question id,
instruction, and option text, the model id, the key as a Bearer header, and a
User-Agent naming oh-my-hermes. OMH adds nothing beyond `state` and the
questions; whatever a skill puts in `state` -- commands, a working directory,
file paths, source diffs, test or error output, file contents -- is sent. Not sent: the Hermes session id,
`purpose`, or any other field. OMH persists no key, no `state`, no question
text, and no reply body; the ledger row is metadata only.

Every outcome is a JSON result, never an exception. Exactly one status,
`answered`, carries `ok: true` and answers; every other status carries
`ok: false` and `answers: null`.
