"""Locked, atomic writes for the memory provider's own state files.

The provider keeps counters (``dreaming.json``), the latest brief
(``consolidation.json``), the served receipt and two bounded journals under
``<omh_home>/memory``. A CLI session and a gateway session can run against the
same home at once, so a read-modify-write that is not serialized loses the
other writer's update, and a plain ``write_text`` that dies half-way leaves a
file no reader accepts. This module is the open-reminders ledger's pattern
(``memory_open_reminders.mark_open_reminder_asked``) made reusable: the
bundle's one sanctioned OS lock on a sidecar lock file beside the target, then
a temporary file in the same directory and ``os.replace``.

A lock timeout raises ``TimeoutError`` (an ``OSError``); the provider swallows
it through ``_safely`` and counts it, so a contended home costs one write and
says so, never the turn. Stdlib only; no import of the ``omh`` control plane.
