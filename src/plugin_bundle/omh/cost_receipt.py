"""What one piece of work cost, summed from records only.

A person asks in chat "how much did this cost?"; the answer has to cover
everything the work used, not only the turns of the session they are typing
in. This reader anchors "the work" on the calling Hermes conversation and adds
up four kinds of recorded spend:

- the conversation's own session rows: the session plus its compression
  continuations (`kanban_board_reader.conversation_session_ids`, the same
  identity set the HUD owns delegate children with);
- delegated Hermes children: every session Hermes marks with
  ``model_config._delegate_from`` below the conversation, walked the way
  Hermes' own cascade walks them (``hermes_state._collect_delegate_child_ids``:
  ``_delegate_from IN (frontier) OR (parent_session_id IN (frontier) AND
  _delegate_from IS NOT NULL)``), so an orchestrator child's own children and
  a child's compression continuation are included;
- fanout units whose dispatch summary carries this conversation's id in
  ``origin_session_id``. `omh coding fanout dispatch` stamps that field from
  ``HERMES_SESSION_ID``, which Hermes injects into every terminal command's
  environment as the session-db id of the spawning conversation. The same
  stamp on the summary covers the run's Hermes-lane and retarget recovery
  attempts;
- Hermes kanban worker runs on tasks whose ``tasks.session_id`` is in the
  conversation. Hermes stamps that column with the originating session when a
  task is created inside an agent loop (``kanban_tools._handle_create``,
  verified against ``state.db`` before stamping), and a worker that creates a
  follow-up task passes its own task's origin on, so the chain stays
  attributed. The worker's own session is the one it stamped on its run as
  ``task_runs.metadata.worker_session_id`` when it reported
  (``kanban_tools._stamp_worker_session_metadata``); that session, its
  continuations and its own delegates are read from the ``state.db`` of the
  profile the run was claimed for. A worker that ran without stamping its
  session is listed as missing -- no timing window or title is used to guess
  which session it was.

Hermes persists spend per API call as deltas into the calling session's own
row (``conversation_loop`` -> ``queue_token_counts``); the in-memory rollup of
a delegate's cost into its parent (``delegate_tool``) is never written back,
so summing a parent and its children's rows does not count a child twice.

Nothing is estimated. A usage row is priced only when Hermes recorded a cost
status other than ``unknown`` (or a cost source), the same rule
``hermes_delegation._informative_cost_row_sql`` applies; everything else is
reported as tokens with no recorded price, never folded into the dollar
figure and never priced from OMH's own ballpark table. A child or unit that
recorded no usage at all is listed as missing, not counted as zero. Metadata
only: ids, models, counts and amounts -- no prompt, reply, or transcript text
is read.
