"""Shared store for the HUD todo artifact.

One todo list per declaring session. A record that knows the host session
that declared it (``session_ref``) lives at
``$OMH_HOME/runtime/todos/<session key>.json``; a record written without one
-- `omh runtime todo set` with no ``--session``, or anything predating the
field -- keeps the home-wide ``$OMH_HOME/runtime/todo.json``. The CLI and the
`omh_todo` plugin tool both write through this module so the schema has a
single source of truth; `runtime_reader` projects the records into the HUD
payload read-only, choosing the file that belongs to the reading session.

The per-session layout is what keeps unrelated sessions apart: a plan
declared from a Slack or Discord gateway session, or from a second live TUI,
is its own file, so it neither overwrites nor renders inside another
session's checklist. Writers sharing one home no longer race for one file.

# inference was wrong in both directions on ordinary input: "verify the retry
# is not blocked on the session limit" read as blocked, while "차단됨: 소유자

# cannot proceed" and is cleared by hand, this is "the person asked for
# something else first" and LAPSES ON ITS OWN.
#
# The reason is written together with a digest of the item list as it stood at
# the moment of deferral, and a reader honours the deferral only while that
# digest still matches the items it is reading. Marking an item done, moving
# which one is active, or re-scoping the list all change the digest, so a
# deferral cannot outlive the plan it was written against. That is the whole
# reason this is a field and not a hand-cleared flag: a flag someone must
# remember to clear is the same forgetting this surface exists to prevent,
# moved one step later. The state is derived from the items rather than
# asserted beside them, so it cannot drift from what the plan is.
#
# One consequence, stated rather than left to be discovered. A writer that
# sends the reason AGAIN alongside a changed item list gets a digest over the
# new list, so that is a new deferral for that list and not the old one
# surviving. Deliberate: the record is the declaration and the writer owns it,
# exactly as with `blocked_reason`. Every writer that does not re-send the

    was before the field existed, and a reader that predates it still reads
    every field it knew.

    record is being written with. The two are always written together and
    never separately -- a reason without a digest would be a deferral nothing
    can lapse, which is the hand-cleared flag this field exists instead of.

    FILLS them, one pending item per phase in delivery order, so the shape of

    phase. A writer that omits the field gets exactly the record this function
    built before the field existed, items and all.

    the record never stores: ``'  I. Story  '`` would be refused as an unknown
    label for a phase the validator writes as ``'I. Story'``.

    ``plan_stage`` names where a PLANNING run stands with the person, and is
    additive-optional on the same terms once more. It is the only field here
    another surface REFUSES work on: `plan_stage_gate` escalates a file edit
    to the host's human-approval gate while a record says
    ``awaiting_acceptance``. So it is a closed vocabulary rather than free
    text, and an unrecognised value raises instead of being stored -- a stamp
    a reader cannot classify would make that gate silent on a plan that
    believes it is guarded, which is the worst of the three states.

    It also says nothing was written, because a cap that truncates and a cap

    absence is spelled by omitting the argument.

    The difference is which way the silence falls. An unknown template name
    hides a coverage rule that WOULD have refused; an unknown plan stage hides
    a gate that would have asked a person. Both are silent failures, but this
    one is silent on the surface that stops work, so a writer that sends
    ``"unaccepted"`` or ``"pending"`` -- near misses a model reaches for --
    must be told rather than quietly left unguarded.

    Membership is tested BEFORE any length bound, and that ordering is the
    whole of the difference between a refusal and a silent arming. Bounding
    first -- the shape every other field here uses, because every other field
    STORES what the caller sent -- truncates ``"awaiting_acceptance_later"``
    to exactly the longest vocabulary member and then finds it in the set, so
    the refusal above would be a promise this function did not keep for any
    string that merely starts the right way. Nothing needs the bound: only a
    vocabulary member is ever returned, so what is stored is bounded by the
    vocabulary itself.

    The same write as a whole-list `set`, reached with one item's worth of
    arguments instead of the whole list. That equivalence is the contract and
    it is enforced structurally rather than by agreement: the new list is the
    stored list with one entry's ``state`` and ``blocked_reason`` replaced,
    and it then goes through ``build_todo_record`` -- the same title, source,
    session, deferral and template handling, the same ``validate_todo_items``,
    the same stamp. There is no second validator here and no second schema; a
    record this produces is byte-equal to the one `set` produces for the same
    plan.

    The template name is read off the stored record and sent back through, so
    a single-item write neither drops it nor escapes it: the phase coverage
    the template imposes is re-checked on the advanced list, exactly as it
    would be on a whole-list `set`. Advancing an item cannot move a
    phase, so this passes for any record this module wrote; a hand-edited
    record that no longer covers its template refuses here, naming the phase,
    and `set` is how it is re-declared.

    A record naming a template this build does not have is the one refusal
    on this path a caller could not act on, so it is relabelled rather than
    passed through. The builder's message tells a writer to send a different
    `template`, and `action=advance` has no such argument -- the name came
    off the record, not off the call -- so a model reading that wording
    would look for an argument it never sent. It is also permanent for that
    record: only `set` clears a stored name, and the replacement says so.
    Reachable today from a hand edit, or from a bundle rolled back under a
    record a newer generation stamped.

    ``item`` is 1-based, the way the checklist reads, and it is guarded rather
    than trusted. ``item_text`` must be a prefix of the text already stored at
    that position, so a reference computed against a list that has since been
    re-set refuses instead of ticking whatever now sits at that index. The
    guard is required for that reason: an unguarded index is exactly the
    silent mis-write this action would otherwise introduce, and the whole
    point of a single-item write is that the caller no longer re-reads the
    list on every advance.

    ``blocked_reason`` replaces the item's recorded reason and omitting it
    clears one, which is what `set` does with a field left out of an item.
    Making it sticky instead would create a record state reachable by `set`
    and not by this, and the equivalence above is what the action is for.

    The whole read-modify-write runs inside the record's lock, so a `set` from
    another turn or another process cannot land between the read and the
    write and be overwritten by a list this call read before it.

    ``observed_calls`` is how a done write on the tool path learns what
    closed the item. Called inside the lock with the stored ``updated_at`` --
    the start of the item's window -- and the evidence keys the other items
    already hold, it returns the calls recorded since, oldest first. The
    store reads no session records itself; the CLI shares this module, passes
    none, and its done writes stay unbound. With a reader:

    * the latest unheld call binds, with ``done_at`` and ``window_start``;
    * none, on an item already done, changes nothing -- a no-op re-advance is
      not a write, so it neither restamps the plan nor reads as progress to
      the turn-end budget (`nudge_budget`);
    * none, on an item newly done, stamps the window with no reference, and
      the stop criterion judges the window.

    Moving the item out of done drops all three, the way `set` refuses them
    on an open item. A call whose record is identical to the stored one apart
    from its stamp is not written at all, for the same reason as above.
