"""Executor-name and coding-delivery phrase groups, owned once by the bundle.

The control plane (`omh.routing.executor_cues`) re-exports these names from
here; the bundle's awareness route hints read them directly. Until 2026-10-06
the bundle carried a vendored copy behind an `ImportError` fallback, and since
Hermes loads the bundle as a top-level package that copy was what the live
plugin always ran, held equal only by a parity test. One definition, no copy.
Stdlib only.
