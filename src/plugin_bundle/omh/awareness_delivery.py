"""Did OMH's awareness hook return a payload for model input?

`pre_llm_call` is how OMH gets its primer and route hint in front of Hermes.
Nothing recorded whether that ever happened:

- `host_observation` is invocation evidence, not evidence that this hook
  returned awareness content. The delivery path therefore needs its own
  metadata-only signal even though Hermes supplies session/task/turn identity.
- Hermes wraps every hook callback in try/except and only logs a warning, so a
  hook that raises disappears without a user-visible trace.

Between those two, awareness could be dead for weeks and the only symptom would
be a user learning to type "load OMH" by hand. This records the one fact that
distinguishes those worlds.

The ledger observes the `pre_llm_call` hook returning injection content, and
that hook leaving the primer to the `omh.awareness` system prompt section
(counted once per session). It is
not host-consumption acknowledgement and does not prove a model received,
processed, or acted on that content.

Counters, not an append-only log. A per-turn log on the hottest path in the
system is how a journal reached ~4.7k rows of noise; a fixed-shape counter file
cannot grow.

    This module is vendored into the user's Hermes install and imports nothing

    took no lock at all here, and the read-modify-write below could interleave
    between concurrent turns and lose counter increments with nothing saying so.

    It is the bundle's one sanctioned lock, which is what makes the deadline a
    parameter: `tool_bursts`, `approval_bypass`, `memory_open_reminders` and
    `todo_store` all take it, and their writes are not all worth the same
    wait. Telemetry that drops a counter under contention and a plan record
    that must not lose a write want opposite answers, and forking the lock so
    each could pick one is how a bundle ends up with three copies of it. So
    the backends, the errno set and the release live here once, and the only
    thing a caller chooses is how long it is willing to wait.

    Both backends use bounded non-blocking attempts and raise `TimeoutError`
