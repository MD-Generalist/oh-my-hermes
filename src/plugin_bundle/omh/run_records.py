"""The on-disk run-record format: one definition for both sides of the seam.

The control plane (`omh.*` outside this bundle) WRITES run, dispatch, and
receipt files; the Hermes-side readers in this bundle READ them. The bundle
cannot import `omh.*`, so the bundle owns the format and the writers import it
from here. Before this module each tree spelled every file name and schema
version itself and parity tests caught drift after the fact; now
`tests/test_run_record_format_policy.py` fails on a second spelling instead.

Names and versions only. No IO lives here: locking, journaling, and every write
stay with the writers.
