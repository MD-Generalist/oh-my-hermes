"""One plain sentence about an orchestration decision, for the model to relay.

Four OMH tools make a decision the person never sees unless the model says
so: which model takes a part of the work (`omh_delegate_route`), what the plan
is and when it counts as done, or which step is blocked or not yet confirmed
(`omh_todo`), what a loop is working toward or waiting on (`omh_loop`), and
which teammate a board lane adds (`omh_agent_board`). Their results carry the
facts in record fields whose names and values are OMH's own vocabulary, and a
model that relays those fields relays the vocabulary with them.

Each builder here turns the fields of one successful result into a `say`
string in plain English. The tool description and the common rail tell the
model to relay it once, in the person's language and its own words; nothing
here is quoted to the person verbatim.

Rules every builder keeps, pinned in `tests/test_orchestration_say.py`:

- Only the decision's own success status gets a sentence. A read, an error, a
  refusal or a contended write returns ``None``, so the result carries no key.
- The sentence states what the record holds and never invents a criterion,
  a reason or a model.
- Nothing from OMH's record vocabulary is added around the echoed values: no
  category id, no reason code, no schema id, no `[OMH ...]` head. Values the
  model wrote (a title, an item, a blocked reason, a goal) are echoed as
  written, so the sentence carries exactly the vocabulary they carry.

Stdlib only and no `omh.*` import: this module runs inside Hermes's own
interpreter. The model labels are vendored from
`omh.catalogs.model_chain_table.MODEL_DISPLAY_LABELS`, and a parity test fails
with the alias to add when the two differ.
