# Per-skill SKILL.md body ceiling (paid on each load, not every request). Ratchet, not a target: raise it only
# with the reason written here. 24_000 held until 2026-09-11, when the
# ultrawork body measured 25_078 bytes after the seven executing-engine bars
# gained the follow-up-authority and closing-brief rules (Codex Desktop prompt
# review, MODEL_OPTI.md); ultrawork already sat 9 bytes under the old ceiling.
# 25_100 held until 2026-09-12, when the ultrawork body measured 25_475 bytes
# after the #1494 executor-owned loop-driver and #1495 advisory
# handoff-risk-scan guidance joined the always-loaded catalog text
# (issues-1485-1505 delivery); the dispatching lane must read both before
# acting, and the sibling FULL_PROFILE_SKILL_BODY_CHAR_LIMIT pin in
# src/maintenance/release.py was re-derived from the same producer on the
# same branch. Warranted always-loaded growth, not drift.
# 25_500 held until 2026-09-16, when the ultrawork body measured 25_836 bytes.
# Its todo-initialization directive moved out of `quality_bar` -- which renders
# under `## Catalog Metadata`, past the point a run has already begun -- into
# the new `## First Steps` section under `## Why This Exists`, and its
# `Completion Checklist` gained two lines for obligations the quality bar
# already carried but the completion contract did not: that the phase todo was
# declared, and that every Hermes-native lane was routed before dispatch. All
# three are the same text in a place a run reads; the 336 bytes are one heading
# and two checklist lines. The sibling FULL_PROFILE_SKILL_BODY_CHAR_LIMIT pin in
# src/maintenance/release.py was re-derived from its own producer on the same
# branch. Warranted always-loaded growth, not drift.
# 25_900 held until 2026-09-17, when the ultrawork body measured 25_911 bytes
# through the gate's own path, `skill_structure_lint_payload()` rendering
# `builtin_definitions()`. (A bare catalog-definition render reads 25_756 and
# is not what this gate measures; an interim revert of this ratchet was made
# on that number and undone.) The body gained one clause pointing a lane
# that must outlive the session at `references/kanban-lane.md`; the create
# recipe, the readback discipline, and the role table live in that
# reference, outside this budget. The sibling ledger pins in
# src/maintenance/release.py were re-derived from their producers on the
# same branch. Warranted always-loaded growth, not drift.
#
# 26_000 -> 26_500: `ultrawork` measures 26_493 through the same gate after
# the two executing-engine rules (follow-up authority, closing brief) and
# the per-skill tail gained the turn-ending sentence: a stop at a boundary
# or at a decision the user owns ends the turn by offering the next action
# as a question, never by declaring what will not be done. The model had
# been closing runs with "I will not merge or force-push here", which left
# the person no next move; the sentence is what every skill's stop
# condition needed and belongs in the always-loaded body because the stop
# is where it is read. Warranted always-loaded growth, not drift.
#
# 26_500 -> 26_800: `ultrawork` measures 26_730 after the tail sentence grew
# to say the reply is written in the user's own words and the host's own
# voice, with OMH's record terms kept to records and tool calls, and after
# the closing brief rule gained "in the user's words". Same reason as the
# entry above: the sentence is read where the reply is written. Warranted
# always-loaded growth, not drift.
#
# 26_800 -> 27_100: `ultrawork` measures 27_012 after the same tail sentence
# named what the voice covers: the host persona's reply language, tone,
# speech level, and sentence endings, progress updates included, with the
# user's language only where the persona sets none and OMH shaping structure
# and content only. The next hundred, 27_000, is under the measured body, so
# the ceiling is the hundred above it. "The host's own voice" alone left a
# casual-register Korean persona writing its interim progress lines in
# English (miku, 2026-09-30). Same reason as the entries above. Warranted
# always-loaded growth, not drift.
