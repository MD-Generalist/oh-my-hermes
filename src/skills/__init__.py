# The render-side exports resolve on first use (PEP 562) instead of at
# package import. Importing any submodule -- `routing.intent` imports
# `catalog_types` -- runs this file, and an eager `from .render import` here
# pulled `render` and, through it, the plugin bundle's `awareness` into every
# router import; `awareness` imports `routing.intent` back, which is the
# cycle #2013 worked around. The catalog names above stay eager: `catalog`
# imports nothing on that path.
