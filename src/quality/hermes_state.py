"""Primitives for reading Hermes' own ``state.db``: the read-only open, the
``sessions.source`` filter, and the stamp parser.

Hermes keeps sessions and messages in ``<hermes_home>/state.db``; the OMH
readers observe it and none writes. The reply lint and the session-usage
report in this package open it through ``open_state_db_readonly``, so both
fail the same way on a missing or unreadable database. The menubar session
reader in ``surfaces.hermes_sessions`` keeps its own open (it reports
``unobserved`` rather than raising) but parses the same stamp column through
``hermes_epoch``, so there is one parser to change when Hermes changes the
stamp shape.
